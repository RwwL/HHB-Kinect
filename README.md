# Kinect bridge for Hungry Hungry Birds
This is an openframeworks+ofxKinect bridge for playing [HHB](https://github.com/RwwL/HHB). It allows players to control their characters in the game by jumping towards the center axis of the Kinect field of view.

This was featured on a stage with a projection screen at [frog](https://frogdesign.com)'s opening party for South by Southwest 2011.
